  <h2> Living Stones Baptist Church </h2>
  <p>
  We are a vibrant and growing multicultural church in the Baptist network established in Plymouth in December 2006.
  We are also part of “Churches Together Plymouth”, a network of Christian churches.

  Instructed by God, Living Stones Baptist Church started with five families. The first service was held on Sunday 3rd Dec 2006 at Pilgrim Primary School.

  We meet at the Abbey Hall, St Andrews church situated in the heart of Plymouth, England.
